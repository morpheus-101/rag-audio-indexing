## üåü Overview
The Dual RAG System for Audio Indexing represents a cutting-edge approach to processing and retrieving information from audio content. By ingeniously combining Basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph RAG methodologies, our system offers unparalleled query processing and information extraction capabilities from audio transcriptions. This innovative dual approach facilitates a more nuanced, context-aware exploration of audio content, enabling users to uncover valuable insights that might otherwise remain hidden in traditional text-based search methods.

## üéØ Motivation
In an era where audio content proliferates across various platforms ‚Äì from podcasts and interviews to lectures and meetings ‚Äì the need for sophisticated audio indexing solutions has never been more pressing. Traditional text-based search methods often fall short when applied to audio transcriptions, failing to capture the rich context, subtle nuances, and complex relationships inherent in spoken language. Our project addresses this critical gap by leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and graph-based knowledge representation, thus revolutionizing how we interact with and extract value from audio content.

## üí° Solution
Our Dual RAG system is built on two complementary pillars, each bringing unique strengths to the table:

1. **Basic RAG Component**: 
   - Utilizes state-of-the-art text indexing and retrieval methods.
   - Processes audio transcriptions through intelligent chunking algorithms.
   - Creates an efficient index structure for rapid information retrieval.
   - Excels in direct keyword matching and general content retrieval tasks.

2. **Graph RAG Component**:
   - Employs an innovative graph-based approach to capture complex entity relationships.
   - Constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph from audio transcriptions.
   - Enables sophisticated querying to uncover indirect relationships and contextual information.
   - Provides a deeper, more interconnected understanding of the audio content.

By synergizing these approaches, our Dual RAG system delivers responses that are not only comprehensive but also context-aware and insightful, setting a new standard in audio content analysis.

## üîë Key Features
- **üöÄ Asynchronous Processing**: Concurrent execution of Basic and Graph RAG queries for optimal performance.
- **üîó Neo4j Integration**: Harnesses the power of Neo4j for efficient storage and retrieval of complex relationship data.
- **üîç Flexible Query Processing**: Simultaneous utilization of both RAG systems for diverse query types and robust results.
- **üìà Scalable Architecture**: Engineered to efficiently handle large volumes of audio transcriptions.
- **üß† Advanced NLP Techniques**: Employs cutting-edge entity and relationship extraction methods.
- **üï∏Ô∏è Community Detection**: Utilizes sophisticated graph algorithms to group related entities.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Customizable Framework**: Easily adaptable to various domains and use cases.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The DualRAGSystem class serves as the cornerstone of our system, orchestrating the seamless interaction between the BasicRAGSystem and GraphRAGSystem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the system architecture:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Ingests audio transcriptions with character-level timestamps.
   - Accepts configuration parameters for system customization.

2. **Dual System Initialization**:
   - BasicRAGSystem: Initialized with transcription data and a specified index name.
   - GraphRAGSystem: Created using transcription data and Neo4j connection details.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - BasicRAGSystem: Asynchronously processes and indexes transcription data.
   - GraphRAGSystem: Constructs a rich knowledge graph from the transcription.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - Incoming queries are concurrently processed by both RAG systems.
   - BasicRAGSystem: Performs advanced text-based retrieval and generation.
   - GraphRAGSystem: Traverses the knowledge graph for contextually relevant information.

5. **Result Aggregation**:
   - Responses from both systems are asynchronously collected.
   - The dual approach yields comprehensive answers that combine direct text matches with graph-based insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
Our system leverages a robust set of technologies and libraries:

- **LlamaIndex**: Core framework for building the RAG system, handling text chunking, indexing, and retrieval.
- **OpenAI GPT models**: Powering entity extraction, relationship identification, and answer generation.
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for efficient storage and querying of the knowledge graph.
- **NetworkX**: Python library for advanced graph operations and community detection algorithms.
- **graspologic**: Utilized for hierarchical community detection using the Leiden algorithm.
- **asyncio and nest_asyncio**: Enabling efficient asynchronous processing for improved performance.
- **SentenceSplitter**: Specialized tool for chunking transcribed text into manageable segments.
- **Custom Classes**: Including GraphRAGExtractor and GraphRAGQueryEngine for specialized graph-based RAG operations.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dual-rag-audio-indexing.git
   cd dual-rag-audio-indexing
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure Neo4j:
   - Install Neo4j and start a local instance, or use a cloud-hosted solution.
   - Update the `config.py` file with your Neo4j credentials and URL.

5. Set up OpenAI API:
   - Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:
     ```
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
     ```

6. Prepare your audio transcriptions:
   - Ensure your transcriptions are in the required format with character-level timestamps.

## üìò Usage Guide
1. Initialize the DualRAGSystem:
   ```python
   from dual_rag_system import DualRAGSystem

   dual_rag = DualRAGSystem(
       transcription_with_char_timestamps="your_transcription_here",
       index_name="your_index_name",
       neo4j_username="your_username",
       neo4j_password="your_password",
       neo4j_url="bolt://localhost:7687"
   )
   ```

2. Prepare the system:
   ```python
   import asyncio

   asyncio.run(dual_rag.prepare_basic_rag())
   ```

3. Query the system:
   ```python
   query = "What are the main topics discussed in the audio?"
   basic_response, graph_response = asyncio.run(dual_rag.query_systems(query))

   print("Basic RAG Response:", basic_response)
   print("Graph RAG Response:", graph_response)
   ```

## üìä Performance and Scalability
