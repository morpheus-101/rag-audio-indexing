    "In this notebook we will see how to build a basic RAG pipeline to answer questions about an audio clip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Convert mp3 file to text and generate time stamps for each character\n",
    "2. Create textnodes and add them to a vector store\n",
    "3. Embedding retrieval from vector store\n",
    "4. Response Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the this RAG pipeline is built from scratch, using custom functions and classes for each step. \n",
    "Data processing, retrieval, and response synthesis are all handled in a custom manner therefore giving more flexibility and control over the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've used Llamaindex for text node creation and basic utility and wrapper functions for RAG pipeline.\n",
